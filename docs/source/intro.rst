EasyPred: simply track your predictions
=======================================

What is it?
--------------------------------
EasyPred is a Python package that allows to
easily store, investigate, assess and compare the predictions obtained
through your Machine Learning models.

The package allows to create different types of model-agnostic
prediction objects simply by passing the real and fitted data. These
objects have properties and methods that return various accuracy and
error metrics.

Why EasyPred can be useful:
* **All-in-one bundle**: having data and accuracy metrics in a single object
means less stuff you need to keep an eye on
* **Minimize code redundancy**: pass the data once and get all the information
and metrics you want
* **Easy and flexible comparison**: create the predictions first and then decide
what to compare. Changed your mind? The object is there, simply access another method
